# Wollok Language

This is the repository for the **Wollok Language definition**, and also the main access point for all resources.

## What is Wollok?

Wollok is a language designed to satisfy our main goals for teaching OO concepts. You can see [Wollok site](www.wollok.org) for further information.

## About this repository

Currently called `wollok-sanity-tests`, we'll rename it to Wollok Language since it'll be a Wollok Project containing

- Wollok core libraries: strings, numbers, dates, booleans, etc. in `src` folder
- Wollok language specification, in form of unit tests: in `test` folder you'll see our **sanity tests** where you can check how should you use Wollok objects from core libraries, and syntax definitions.
